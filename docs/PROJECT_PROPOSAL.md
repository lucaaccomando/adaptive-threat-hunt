# Adaptive Network Threat Hunting & CTF Playground — Proposal

## Problem
Students lack a light, reproducible network-hunting pipeline to experiment with capture, feature extraction, and ML detection.

## Goal
Build an end-to-end demo: capture → extract → detect → display. Add CTF-style attacks to reproduce detections.

## Deliverables
- Code repo (this one)
- Feature extractor
- Isolation Forest baseline
- Flask dashboard
- CTF attack stubs
